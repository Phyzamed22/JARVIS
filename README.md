# 🧠 Jarvis – Personalized Conversational AI Assistant (v1)

**Jarvis** is a real-time, voice-enabled conversational AI agent designed as a personalized digital assistant. Built as the first version of a long-term vision to create a fully autonomous, desktop-controlling companion (like Marvel's JARVIS/FRIDAY), this MVP focuses on providing natural, real-time conversations through voice interaction using advanced LLMs.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ **Real-Time Voice Conversation**  
  Engage with Jarvis naturally using your voice, powered by Web Speech API (STT) and Piper TTS (for offline text-to-speech).

- 🤖 **LLM-Backed Chat Engine**  
  Uses [Groq Inference API](https://groq.com) to generate intelligent, context-aware responses in milliseconds.

- 🧑‍💻 **Personalized Interactions**  
  Jarvis learns from previous chats and adapts responses to user tone and style (early-stage memory prototype).

- ⚡ **Fast + Lightweight**  
  Runs efficiently on local environments, combining local TTS with a remote LLM API to balance speed and capability.

- 🌐 **Web App Interface**  
  Built as a sleek web app using [V0/Tailwind CSS] for UI, designed to be converted into a desktop app with Electron.
